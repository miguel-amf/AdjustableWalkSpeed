# Adjutable Walk Speed on Steroids™

Adjustable Walk Speed is a quality of life mod for The Long Dark. But with Steroids™, you start to fly low. They wolf will see you rollin', they hatin'

It allows players to adjust the walk speed (and only the walk speed) of your character for some more cinematic and immersive moments. And now, with Steroids™, allows you to cosplay Barry Allen
Scroll down to decrease walk speed to 30% of the normal walk speed and scroll up to increase it back up to the full walk speed. You cannot increase the speed more than the standard walk speed to move faster... except you can!

## Installation

Just so I don't release the Kraken of cheats to the commoners, you gotta discover yourself, random TLD player, how to compile. Good luck!
